+++**Maintenance Update on January 12, 2024**

### Maintenance Update on January 12, 2024

#### Boards

**Cannot attach a document to a card**

When a user attempts to attach a document to a connected card, the user can select the document to attach, but the document does not appear in the document area of the card, and the document is not attached to the object that the card is connected to.

This has been reported in cards connected to issues.

**Card appears on multiple sprints**

When a user is viewing a sprint on Boards, cards that are in different sprints appear on the board. This issue is intermittent.

**Card doesn't close when using Boards view in a Project**

When a user is viewing the Boards view on a task list in a project, and creates a card, the card does not close or save. This prevents the user from returning to the project.

To close the card, the user must edit the URL to remove "board" and anything to the right of "board."

**Cards persist when changing iteration**

When a user is viewing an iteration on a board and then changes the iteration, the cards displaying for the new iteration are the cards from an iteration the user was viewing previously. 

**Error in [!UICONTROL Comments] section of cards**

When a user is viewing a card and scrolls to the [!UICONTROL Comments], section, comments are not displayed, and the user sees the following error:

"[!UICONTROL Something went wrong. Please try again later.]"

**Issues when viewing subtask status**

The following issues have been reported regarding viewing subtask status on a card in Boards:

* The status is shown as "Select status" even when the task already has a status. This status can be seen when viewing the task directly.
* If the user attempts to select a status, the screen goes blank and must be refreshed.

**"[!UICONTROL You have no access]" when viewing comments on a card**

When a user attempts to view comments on a card that is not connected to a [!DNL Workfront] object, they see the following message: 

"[!UICONTROL You have no access to view comments on this object]"

This may occur even when the user could previously see comments on the card.

### 2023年1月11日维护更新

#### 展示板

**完成的卡片未在动态展示板上正确加载**

以前，在动态展示板上包含已完成工作的唯一方法是将信息卡加载为存档信息卡。 否则，完成的卡根本未加载到主板上。 这会导致无法找到信息卡的问题。

现在，在创建动态展示板时，已完成的卡片默认作为已存档的卡片加载，但您可以选择不存档已完成的卡片，以将所有已完成的卡片作为可见卡片加载到展示板上“已完成”列。
